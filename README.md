# 🧠 AgentBridge – The WordPress of AI Agents

**Reliable AI agents, no AI team required.**

AgentBridge is a powerful platform designed to help teams rapidly deploy intelligent AI agents by simply plugging in their API documentation. Forget months of ML development, data wrangling, or hiring expensive AI engineers. With AgentBridge, companies can convert their existing APIs into robust, predictable AI agents that plug directly into their apps in under an hour.

## 🔮 Vision

**Democratize AI agent integration.**

Our mission is to make AI agents as easy to integrate and scale as Stripe or Twilio — turning any developer into an AI builder. With AgentBridge, your business logic, workflows, memory, and even custom UI components can be automatically generated from your API specs, enabling instant and cost-effective deployment of intelligent systems.

Imagine Acme Corp — a company that wants AI automation but doesn’t have the team or budget. Instead of spending \$100k+ building bespoke agents, they drop in their OpenAPI spec, a few config files, and get production-grade AI agents embedded into their app — complete with memory, personalization, and internet access.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 API-to-Agent Conversion

Just upload your OpenAPI, GraphQL, or gRPC spec. AgentBridge automatically turns it into:

* Conversational agents
* Natural language API wrappers
* Auto-validated requests/responses
* Pre-built command interfaces

**Example:**

```yaml
User: “Find me the user named John”
Agent: "Found 1 user: John (id: 1234)"
```

---

### ⚙️ Workflow Engine

Define multi-step agent workflows using a simple YAML structure. Each plan ensures:

* Reliable, validated API call sequences
* Data extraction from unstructured responses
* Built-in error handling & retries

**Example:**

```yaml
Plan:
1. Search "turf.io" company info
2. Summarize results
3. Post findings to internal service
```

---

### 👩‍💻 Developer-Friendly Setup

Simple JS SDK integration. No AI experience needed.

```js
import { AgentBridge } from 'agentbridge';

const agent = new AgentBridge({
  apis: ['./openapi.yaml'],
  memory: true,
  tools: ['search', 'calculator']
});
```

Add a route to your app in seconds:

```js
app.use('/agent', agent.middleware());
```

---

### 🧱 Built-in UI Kit

Use our auto-generated React components to embed:

* Conversational UIs
* Form-driven agents
* Chat bots
* Modal workflows

```jsx
<AgentBridgeChatUI endpoint="/agent" />
```

---

### 🧠 User Memory & Personalization

Each user’s preferences and history are remembered for hyper-personalized experiences.

**Example:**

```
User: “I’m vegetarian.”
Later...
User: “Find nearby restaurants.”
Agent: “Here are vegetarian restaurants nearby.”
```

---

### 🌍 Internet-Ready & Tool-Enabled

Use prebuilt tools or define your own:

* Web search
* Code execution
* RAG from private documents
* Knowledge queries

```js
tool.execute('search', { query: 'life expectancy' });
```

---

## 🛠 Use Cases

* **Customer support agents** with personalized knowledge
* **Sales assistants** that query CRMs and auto-fill forms
* **Healthcare intake bots** with guided workflows
* **Legal research tools** powered by RAG + internet tools
* **DevOps copilots** that wrap internal APIs in English
